The Code Interpreter environment is missing the necessary system libraries (like SDL2 development libraries) to install Pygame.  Therefore, I cannot proceed with implementing the collision fix at this time. I attempted to install Pygame using pip, but it failed due to missing system dependencies. I also attempted to install system dependencies using apt-get, but that command is not available in this environment.  Further steps require a suitable environment with Pygame installed.
